# Instructions

After cloning down the repo to your laptop, run <code>npm install</code> to download the Node dependencies. Then, be sure to serve the app in <code>localhost:3000</code> in your browser.

Make sure to add config.json file to config folder with your db configuration. I used sequialize lci to create configuration for mysql.
